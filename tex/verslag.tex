% Due to the unfortunate outcome of a war somewhere in the Middle East,
% the government has found it necessary to introduce a rationing scheme for petrol,
% where all car owners receive a fixed monthly petrol allowance.
%
% Design and implement a smartcard-based petrol rationing scheme.
% This application should consist of:
%
% a petrol rationing applet, and
% a petrol pump terminal
% a charging terminal
% All car owners are given a petrol rationing smartcard that keeps
% track of how much of their petrol allowance they still have.
% All petrol pumps are equipped with card terminals, and will only
% supply petrol upon presentation of a petrol rationing smartcard,
% and subtract the amount of petrol supplied from the allowance on that card.
% There are special terminals for charging rationing cards.
% Inserting the card in a charging terminal will increase the allowance
% by the fixed monthly allowance - provided the card hasn't been charged
% already that month.
